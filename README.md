# llvm-android

Build scripts to generate a bleeding edge LLVM toolchain based on [Google's build scripts](https://android.googlesource.com/toolchain/llvm_android/).

Prebuilts can be found at https://ftp.travitia.xyz/clang/.

## TODO

* Figure how to make BOLT more efficient (takes up way too much space right now)
